# Robot Rover Simulator Terminal Game

## Concept:
* Explore distance planets on a robot rover with a simple terminal game!
* Easy text-based command-line controls give users an interactive experience
* Terminal interface provides feedback on rover status, planet environmental conditions, and surprises
* Physics-based modeling varies from planet to planet, making each game unique

## Possible Features & Principles:
* Rover navigation
* Environmental analysis
* Planet-based physics modeling (using real gravitational constants)
* Energy management
* Obstacle detection & avoidance
* Mission objectives (collect points, reach coordinates, map areas)
* Command queue (pre-plan action sequences, like a delayed execution for a real rover)
* Real-time logs
* Create your own planet/moon/asteroid 

## Proposed UX:
* Simple, command-line terminal interface
* ASCII map showing rover pose, terrain features, obstacles
* Text-command interface
* Simple, engaging narrative
